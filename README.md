Coursera-Machine-Learning-Project
=================================

Github page for the Coursera Machine Learning Project (Data Science track, level 8)

The file `mach_learning_project.rmd` is the knitr document that performs the analysis. 

The file `index.html` contains the results of the analysis (I renamed `mach_learning_project.rmd` to `index.html` to create a github page).

Besides, here is the link to the github page (that shows the content of `index.html`)
